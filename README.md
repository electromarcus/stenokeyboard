# stenokeyboard
A custom specialty keyboard that will work with Plover, an open source stenography software, that lets me type much faster and type whole words at once. It will use a raspberry pi pico and a custom case that I design, along with some keyboard switches, and some LEDs in the case for aesthetics, and a PCB to connect it all. It is wired so doesn't need batteries, but does need Plover to be installed on the computer it connects to.
